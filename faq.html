  F.A.Q 

Q: Are there any upfront fees? 

A: Absolutely NOT, Kent Bond Group will never ask you for a penny. The actual process does require many hours of labour, attorney fees and administrative costs, ongoing governmental audits, filing claims, legal opinion letters, and much more. This all comes out of our pocket until we successfully obtain a refund for you, we only only receive a portion of the money that we recover for you AFTER all the work is done. 

Q: How soon can I get my Refund?

A: It depends. If there is a refund available it typically takes between 60-120 days to process a claim. We work as quickly as possible and will notify you if a refund is available sooner. Sometimes the process can be quicker depending on the State.

Q: Can I handle the claim process myself?

A: You can absolutely do that.  Where you would start is another question entirely.  There are countless piles of government records that our researchers have to sort through to identify correctly if you may be owed money and what’s the best strategy to collect it is. 
However, you can absolutely do all the work, research, filing, attorney fees, claims, and pay all costs yourself.  The process is very long and tedious, we are experts in the field and working with us will almost guarantee results. 

Q: How did you find me and my contact information? 

A: Kent Bond Group is in the business of helping people collect funds that they did not know was owed to them, our company is extremely sophisticated in finding these funds and also the people that they legally belong to

Q: How do we get started. 

A: Reach out to Kent Bond Group and we will discuss your claim in more detail and send the required paperwork out to you to be signed. We by law are required to have a Licensed, Insured and Bonded Notary Public complete the paper work with you. Once we receive all the paperwork back, then we will put your claim package together and file it with the proper agency within 48 hours.  We will keep you informed throughout the entire process until the money is in your hands. 

We believe in open communication and building relationships with our clients, we will always make ourselves available for you, you will have your representatives cell phone number and email address so you can call, text and email anytime.
